Videos should be saved in the folder which indicates their topics.

Due to the size restriction (25MB), I cannot upload videos to github.

For example, visual video and thermal video for "MS_test1" should be stored in folder *MS_test1*.
If there are no video "MS_test1_RGB.avi" and "MS_test2_THERMAL.avi" in folder *MS_test1/*, please ask Leigh for the videos.
